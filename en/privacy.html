                <p>
                    Our privacy policy is <strong>a statement that defines how we treat the information we collect from you</strong>. All of our services provide a better experience by treating the information we collect as described in our privacy policy.

                    <h3>How is the information generally handled</h3>
                    <p>
                        In general, information is used within the service for the following purposes
                    </p>
                    <div class="h4card">
                        <h4>1. Realization of application functions</h4>
                        <p>
                            Without the storage of customer information, some of the basic functions that make up the service may not be possible. An example of this is the storage of settings. 
                            <br>In this case, if the information is not stored, the function of the application itself will not be possible in the first place.

                        <h4>2. Analysis of applications and marketing</h4>
                        <p>
                            By analyzing how the app is being used and what kind of customers are using it, we can make the app better. 
                            <br>Also, when a problem occurs with an app, knowing which device or version is causing the problem can help us solve the problem faster.

                        <p>
                            By analyzing how the application is being used and what kind of customers are using it, we can suggest content and behavior that customers are looking for.
                            <br>Although not employed in Iroiro's service, another method is to place advertisements.

                        <br>However, if the app uses a third party service, the third party service may collect information. Currently, we do not have any such apps, but if we do, we will post a notice on this page, in the App Store, and in the app itself.
